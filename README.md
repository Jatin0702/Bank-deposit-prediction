## Results and Insights

- **Total Contacts**: 1,032 people were contacted in August.
- **Conversion Rate**: 11.82% of contacts subscribed.
- **High-Converting Groups**:
  - **Job Roles**: Unemployed (26.47%), Retired (19.35%), Students (17.48%).
  - **Age Groups**: 26-35 had the highest conversion volume (35 successful conversions).
  - **Previous Contact**: Clients with multiple prior contacts had a conversion rate of up to 50%.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Cellular contacts performed better than telephone calls.
  - Campaigns on days 8, 15, and 22 saw higher engagement.
